# Week-1-Homework

## Description

This was a homework assignment for my coding bootcamp. The original code for the site was very general and needed semantics to make it easier to read. It also did not meet key accessibility standards.

## Change Log

*Update 1
1) Changed some source code to semantic HTML elements. 
2) Adjusted elements to a more logical structure. 
3) Improved accessibility by adding 'alt' attributes 
4) Put heading attributes in sequential order. 
5) Changed title element.

**Update 2
1) Fixed links
2)Added HTML comments
3)Updated README.md

## What I learned

While working on this challenge, I learned that one must be cognizant of the fact that changing HTML elements also requires one to change the corresponding css stylesheet when refactoring existing code. I also learned a lot about accessibility requirements and how the lack thereof can adversely affect search engine optimization. Possibly the most imortant thing I learned however, is that when you are confused or stumped on how to make something work, or what elements to use for example, it is very important to not only do your own research, but also to reach out to peers to get their input and perpective as well.

## Challenges

One of the main challenges I faced during this project was the fact that, coming into this bootcamp, I had little to no viable experience with 'HTML' and 'css' languages. This required quite a bit of research outside of class to fully understand how to optimize code for easier reading, the different semantic HTML elements & corresponding css elements, and accessibility standards.
